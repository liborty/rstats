### Synopsis

This is a lean minimalistic crate (library) that only depends on `anyhow` (for its error handling).

The functions supplied compute all three different means (arithmetic, geometric and harmonic) of i64 and f64 vectors (slices).

Also included are their linearly weighted versions useful for time dependent data analysis.

Correlation and autocorrelation.

Median and quartiles.

More facilities will be added in future versions.
